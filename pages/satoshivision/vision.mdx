# What is the Satoshi Nakamoto Vision?

Satoshi Nakamoto's vision is for everyone to trade without any form of human control, and for now, this idea remains difficult to realize in the real financial world, especially when the pricing power of mainstream cryptocurrencies is in the hands of Wall Street. Nonetheless, people at the forefront of the times still won't stop exploring blockchain, and the trend toward decentralized finance will continue to move forward as it grinds and tests its way against mainstream finance. As Plato said, “All great things tower over the storm.”
