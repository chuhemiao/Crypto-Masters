# 6. The combination of cryptocurrency and AI

## 1. What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is, essentially, an intelligence created by humans. It “learns” large amounts of knowledge through algorithms, data, and regulatory parameters to achieve specific intelligent behaviors. Although AI has made significant advances in many areas, it is still in its relatively early stages, based on “big models” that extract knowledge from data and are optimized by algorithms to create the ability to simulate “intelligence”.

For example, traditional learning is a gradual and cumulative process: we “pour” knowledge into our brains from childhood through continuous learning. For AI, we can provide a large amount of data to quickly “feed” the model, so that it can analyze the data to form certain laws. For example, the earliest Tencent QQ robot, it is just a simple dialog system, does not have the ability to understand the context. The emergence of GPT enables the dialog system to understand the user's intent based on the input and reason to provide answers that better meet the needs. The key to generative AI is its ability to generate content that meets the needs based on user input.

## 2. Integration of AI with cultural contexts

The application of AI is not globally uniform, especially across languages and cultural contexts. For example, DeepSeek is an AI model optimized specifically for the Chinese context. As Chinese has more contextual meanings in expression, DeepSeek is able to provide more locally relevant answers in specific Chinese cultural contexts. This variability also suggests that different countries' cultures and environments affect the way AI works, for example, GPT performs better in English environments compared to Chinese environments, which is similar to the difference between Google Translate and DeepL.

The rapid rise of DeepSeek, especially in the financial and language processing fields, proves the importance of deep integration of AI with local cultures. developed by a company in Hangzhou, China, DeepSeek not only relies on the support of large technology companies, but also grows rapidly through a unique technological path, showing the differences in the development of the AI industry in different geographies.

## 3. The trend of combining AI agent with cryptocurrency

With the advancement of AI technology, the application of AI agent is starting to enter the cryptocurrency field as a new opportunity. In the traditional search engine era, users need to manually input keywords to query relevant information. But with the help of AI agent, users can express their needs directly to the system through dialog, and the system will understand the context, automatically generate the most relevant answers and perform the corresponding operations. For example, when you type “exchange USDC with Solana”, the AI can understand the transaction you want to make, and automatically complete the matching and execution. This intent-based model is an important breakthrough in the integration of cryptocurrency and AI.

In the field of cryptocurrency, especially in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, AI agent can greatly enhance the user's interactive experience, simplify the operation process, reduce cumbersome manual input, and improve transaction efficiency and accuracy. For example, combining AI and smart contracts, users only need simple instructions, and the system behind can automatically match the optimal trading pair and complete the transaction, greatly enhancing the user experience.

## 4. Combination of AI skills with smart contracts and DAOs

AI skills can further optimize cryptocurrency applications through decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and smart contracts. The combination of smart contracts and AI skills makes the decentralized management model more efficient and transparent.AI can host and manage DAOs, and execute autonomous decisions through smart contracts.AI can also help avoid common problems such as misuse of funds, malicious asset transfers, and so on. By setting up rules and models in advance, AI can run autonomously and continuously optimize the decision-making process based on voting results.

This model can not only improve the transparency of decision-making, but also bring more innovation to the decentralized finance and cryptocurrency industry, enhancing the autonomy and security of the system. If AI further develops to the stage of autonomous innovation, it could revolutionize the way cryptocurrencies and smart contracts operate, driving automation and intelligence throughout the ecosystem.

## 5. The Possibility of Autonomous AI

As AI technology continues to evolve, we may see AI gradually develop into an autonomous conscious intelligence. While we are still in the “reasoning” stage of AI, one day in the future, AI may become advanced enough to innovate on its own and take over the role of humans in certain areas. Although this stage may still be a decade or more away, with the advancement of technology, AI's autonomous consciousness may become a reality one day in the future.

## 6. The Future of AI and Cryptocurrencies

Regarding the future of AI and cryptocurrencies, I personally believe that AI will remain a very hot field in the next few years. Even if it is currently in a bubble, AI will be useful in more areas as the technology matures. As mentioned in a discussion with peers the other day, the combination of AI and cryptocurrencies will usher in more practical application scenarios this year, especially in stable coins, decentralized identity authentication, smart contracts, and other on-the-ground applications.

The combination of AI and cryptocurrencies will not just be limited to existing applications; it will expand further to explore more innovative usage scenarios. The future cryptocurrency system may be built entirely by AI and Web3 technology, in which AI will play a key role in promoting the autonomous operation of decentralized networks and the optimized execution of smart contracts.

## Conclusion

While the current buzz around AI technology is still somewhat bubbly, AI will play an increasingly important role in the cryptocurrency and Web3 space as the technology continues to advance. Whether it is in the automation of transactions, optimization of smart contracts, or DAO governance and decentralized autonomy, the combination of AI will bring smarter and more efficient solutions to the industry. In the future, the combination of AI and cryptocurrency will provide us with a smarter and decentralized digital ecosystem.
