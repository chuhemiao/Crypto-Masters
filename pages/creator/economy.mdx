# What is Creator Economy ?

The term “Creator” was first coined by Youtube in 2011 to replace the layman's title of “Youtube Star”, and has since been widely used to refer to users who produce content on various Internet platforms. According to Wikipedia, the term “Creator Economy” refers to a new economic model that allows creators to earn income from the creation of digital content with the help of Internet platforms. We can also think of the Creator Economy as a subset of the Passion Economy, which is more focused on Internet platform content and is a business model in which Internet users build communities of audiences and generate economic revenue with the help of a range of creator tools.
