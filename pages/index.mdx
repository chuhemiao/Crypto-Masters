# Introduction

The cryptocurrency fundamentals document from 5 years ago is perhaps a little outdated in some respects, and with 2025, it's time to refresh myself and leave some content behind to help more people get into the world of Web3, and of course most importantly to document my thinking.

I'll be updating some of the content every week and aim to finish the book in the first half of 2025.

## 1.1 My view of the crypto world

Sixteen years since the birth of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies have also been gradually moving into the public eye, and after the ETFs for Bitcoin and Ether were approved by the SEC in 2024, cryptocurrencies officially entered the capital era, and with global policy and compliance pressures, cryptocurrencies based on Bitcoin are legal in some regions, and with the U.S. election behind us, perhaps in 2025 there will be A new turn, Trump is implicitly communicating that he will make Bitcoin one of the government's reserve currencies, and as a federal state where every state is autonomous, even some regions can't buy cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin using coinbase, so it's just a sign of the US dollar hegemony over nearly half of the world, and the currency of some smaller countries has depreciated severely, so some governments go for reserves of Bitcoin.

If more companies, organizations, and countries use bitcoin as a reserve in the future, there may not be enough to buy it, and with just a few million bitcoins in circulation, supply and demand will continue to push up the price of bitcoin.

Of course, in this era of the creator economy, the future of the Internet or web3 will see a brand new situation, perhaps with eth as the dominant world computer, L1+L2 pattern, or perhaps with Sol, ICP, Near, TON based on the new public chain, through a combination of protocols to dominate the new value of the Internet.

## 1.2 Virtual Society and the Crypto Era under AI

Crypto and AI, perhaps the most advanced technology and innovation of this century at present, also or known as the singularity, cryptocurrencies allow globalization to further accelerate, whether it is the traditional SWIFT financial cross-border, or shopping offsite settlement, cryptocurrencies have greatly reduced the original cost, and stable coins are dominating the market, for example, like the issuer of the USDT, USDC and other issuers every year, there are billions of dollars of Pure profit.

Nvidia, openAI, tesla as the dominant ai era, also kicked off the prelude, chatgpt makes generative ai possible, and currently can also deal with video, audio, content context, ai's 5 layers, dialogue, reasoning, autonomy, innovation, and organization, and currently has accelerated to the third layer, that is, the ai agent, the ai's autonomy to run, such as over the future Give ai more models and arithmetic, it will evolve faster to the final organizational model, perhaps the future of the company is not in the people to dominate, but the AI in the management, in the innovation, in the construction of a new era, such as through the ai can increase the possibilities of the era, then for the future of the virtual society and meta-universe may be a new possibility.

The U.S. upload upload in the drama, after the death of human beings, can be uploaded by uploading the consciousness and brain for secondary survival, that is, virtual society, and here used quantum computer, AI, blockchain and other technologies, so based on this possibility, perhaps before the next century, we will see a brand new era.
